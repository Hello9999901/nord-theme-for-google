# nord-theme-for-google

### This is a singular css file that injects a nord theme on the client side of google. 

# Using it
 - On Safari, Tamperish can be used. 
 - On Chrome and Firefox, a custom Stylish or Greasemonkey script will achieve the same objective.

## NOTE:
### Please note that this is early in its development stage. The main search results for google are close be being completed, but there are many places where the CSS does not reach. Please file an issue or PR so I can be aware of such. The other pages are not touched, though more general css has altered it to a certain degree.
