# Nord Theme for Google - Designed and Created by Hello9999901

### This is a singular css file that injects a nord theme on the client side of google.

## Using Nord Theme for Google
 - On Safari, Tamperish can be used. 
 - On Chrome and Firefox, a custom Stylish or Greasemonkey script will achieve the same objective.

### Features -
 - Preferences inside CSS
 - Pure CSS, no JS
 - Only one file
 - Hackable
 - Variable color based
 - Open Source
 - 99% of CSS selectors are commented and documented (Google's css selectors seem to be either arbitrarily generated by their JavaScript or written in an extreme shorthand that I cannot comprehend)

### Caveats - 
 - Only works on desktop so far
 - Performance may drop, though by a small margin

### NOTE:
#### Please note that this is early in its development stage. The main search results for google are close be being completed, but there are many places where the CSS does not reach. Please file an issue or PR so I can be aware of such. The other pages are not touched, though more general css has altered it to a certain degree.
